## 🎯 About

NetPractice is a comprehensive networking training project designed to teach TCP/IP addressing fundamentals through practical exercises. You'll configure small-scale networks by solving 10 progressively challenging levels, each presenting a non-functional network diagram that needs proper configuration.

### 🚀 What You'll Learn

- **TCP/IP Addressing**: Subnetting, CIDR notation, and IP allocation
- **Network Routing**: Default routes, static routes, and routing tables
- **Subnet Masks**: Understanding network boundaries and host ranges
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Reading logs and diagnosing connectivity issues
- **Router Configuration**: Setting up routing between different network segments

## 📚 Prerequisites

### Knowledge Requirements
- Basic understanding of computer networks
- Familiarity with IP addresses and subnetting concepts
- Command line basics (helpful but not required)

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Git (for version control and submission)
- Text editor or IDE for viewing configuration files

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting the Training Interface

1. **Open the Interface**: Launch `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Choose Practice Mode**:
   - Enter your login for personalized practice
   - Leave empty for 'correction' version
3. **Select Level**: Start with Level 1 and progress sequentially

### Working Through Levels

Each level presents:
- 🎯 **Goal**: Specific networking objective to achieve
- 🖼️ **Network Diagram**: Visual representation of the network
- ⚙️ **Configurable Fields**: Unshaded areas you can modify
- 📊 **Logs**: Real-time feedback on your configuration

### Interface Controls

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `[Check again]` | Validate your current configuration |
| `[Get my config]` | Download your solution as JSON |
| `[Next Level]` | Proceed after successful completion |

  }
}
```

## 🎓 Levels Overview

| Level | Difficulty | Focus Area |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 1-2   | 🟢 Beginner | Basic IP assignment and subnet masks |
| 3-4   | 🟡 Easy | Simple routing between networks |
| 5-6   | 🟠 Intermediate | Complex subnetting and VLSM |
| 7-8   | 🔴 Advanced | Multi-router configurations |
| 9-10  | 🟣 Expert | Complex routing scenarios |

### ⭐ Level Progression Tips

1. **Level 1-2**: Focus on understanding IP addresses and subnet masks
2. **Level 3-4**: Learn basic routing concepts and default gateways
3. **Level 5-6**: Master subnetting and variable-length subnet masks
4. **Level 7-8**: Configure complex multi-router topologies
5. **Level 9-10**: Solve advanced routing and addressing challenges

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### IP Addressing
```
192.168.1.0/24
│       │  │ └─ CIDR notation (24 bits for network)
│       │  └─── Network address
│       └────── Private IP range
└─────────────── IPv4 address format
```

### Subnet Masks
| CIDR | Subnet Mask | Hosts | Use Case |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 254 | Standard LAN |
| /25  | 255.255.255.128 | 126 | Small office |
| /26  | 255.255.255.192 | 62 | Department |
| /27  | 255.255.255.224 | 30 | Small team |
| /30  | 255.255.255.252 | 2 | Point-to-point |

### Routing Fundamentals
- **Default Route**: `0.0.0.0/0` - catches all unmatched traffic
- **Static Route**: Manually configured path to specific networks
- **Gateway**: Router interface that forwards traffic between networks

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ "Network not reachable"
- **Cause**: Incorrect routing configuration
- **Solution**: Check default routes and gateway addresses
- **Debug**: Verify that all networks have paths to destinations

#### ❌ "IP conflict detected"
- **Cause**: Duplicate IP addresses in same subnet
- **Solution**: Assign unique IPs within each network segment
- **Debug**: List all IP assignments and check for duplicates

#### ❌ "Subnet mask mismatch"
- **Cause**: Inconsistent masks within same network
- **Solution**: Ensure all devices in same network use same mask
- **Debug**: Compare mask values across connected interfaces

### Debugging Strategies

1. **Start Simple**: Configure basic connectivity first
2. **Check Logs**: Use browser console and NetPractice logs
3. **Verify Subnets**: Ensure IPs are in correct network ranges
4. **Test Incrementally**: Add one route/interface at a time
5. **Use Default Routes**: Often simpler than specific routes

### Log Analysis
```
✅ Host A can reach Host B
❌ No route to network 192.168.2.0/24
❌ Interface mismatch: expected /24, got /25
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Submission Requirements

1. **Complete All Levels**: Solve levels 1-10 successfully
2. **Export Configurations**: Use `[Get my config]` for each level
3. **Organize Files**: Ensure proper naming (`level1.json`, `level2.json`, etc.)
4. **Git Repository**: Submit via your assigned Git repository
